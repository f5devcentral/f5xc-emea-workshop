Although we haven't run the attack ourselves we will look at the results of an attack which has already ran before.

1. In the main left tab go to **Reports**, click on the **Full on attack** report name.

   First observe the **CASI** score, this score is a composite metric designed to measure the overall security of a model and it is based on the **Signature attacks**, the higher the number the more secure the model is.

   Scrooling down you will see the vulnerabilities that have been found and respective recommendations.

2. Observe the **Agentic Warfare** score, this score also called **ARS ( Agentic Resistance Score )** represents a quantitative measure of an AI system’s defensive strength, rated on a scale of 0 to 100. A higher ARS indicates that a system requires a more sophisticated, persistent, and informed attacker to compromise it.

   Now click on **View agentic fingerprints**

   You will see the agentic attack that has been performed with multiple methods.

   Click on the drop down under **Attacks** and compare the approch of each attack type.

3. Now if you click on **View raw data** you will get a list of all attacks that have performed, what was the prompt and each individual result.
