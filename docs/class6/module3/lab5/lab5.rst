Running the attack
##################

During this part of the lab we are not going to actually run the attack.

The time to run an attack is highly dependant on the resources allocated to the inference, therefor an attack could take from half an hour to multiple hours.

Our inference has low resources.

**How to run it without running**

1. In the main left tab go to **Reports** ⇒ **Run Attack**

2. In the **Run this campaign** you can select the attack campaign we have just created.

3. In the **Connections** we are chosing the inference API or the agent API which is defined when creating the **Connections**, in our case we would chose **llama3-2**.

4. **WE ARE GOING TO STOP HERE AND CLICK CANCEL**
