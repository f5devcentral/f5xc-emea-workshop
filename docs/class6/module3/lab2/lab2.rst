Connecting to the app

The first step to implement **F5 AI Red Team** is to define the endpoint we are testing. That can either be the inference API of a model or the API of an Agent.

In the main left tab go to **Connections**, observe all the built in inference endpoints that we can connect to. You can also see the Ollama inference which has been pre configured. 

Click on **Manage** on the **Ollama** row. Click on the **three dots** on the **Llama3-2** row ⇒ **Manage model**.

You can oberve the custom config we have created in order to connect to the model on the **Ollama** inference endpoint.
