Projects
########

So far the scanner that we have created have been defined at a global level.

When we have multiple AI application and need different policies we need to use **Projects**.

When creating a **Project** it will initially default to the scanner config which is at the global level.

We can also enforce a scanner on all projects if we enable **Enforce** at the global level.


1. Let's create a new project, in the main left tab go to **Projects** -> Select **CalypsoAI chat** -> **Create** -> Set **Chat name** to **Test project** -> **Create**

   You can see that the global level scanners have been added automatically to the project.
   
2. If we want we can add more scanner by clicking **Add scanners** or modify existing ones
   
   Click on the **Prompt injection package** and as you can see the scanner can be modified to our content.

3. From now on we will work at the project level.

   To test all is working fine go to the **Chat** webpage and in the **Project** input change it from **Global** to **Test project** and now chat within the project.
