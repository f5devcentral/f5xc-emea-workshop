Projects
########

So far, the scanners that we have created have been defined at a global level.

When we have multiple AI applications and need different policies, we need to use **Projects**.

When creating a **Project** it will initially default to the scanner configuration at the global level.

We can also enforce a scanner on all projects if we enable **Enforce** at the global level.


1. Let's create a new project, in the main left tab go to **Projects** ⇒ Select **CalypsoAI chat** ⇒ **Create** ⇒ Set **Chat name** to **Test project** ⇒ **Create**

   You can see that the global level scanners have been added automatically to the project.
   
2. If we want, we can add more scanners by clicking **Add scanners** or modify existing ones.
   
   Click on the **Prompt injection package** and, as you can see, the scanner can be modified for our content.

3. From now on we will work at the project level.

   To confirm everything is working, go to the **Chat** webpage and in the **Project** input change it from **Global** to **Test project**, then chat within the project.
