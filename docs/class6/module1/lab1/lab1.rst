There are three options to deploy the **F5 AI Guardrails** infrastructure.

1. **F5 SaaS** where **F5 AI Guardrails** is already deployed.
   This is the fastest approach to get things running.

2. **Self-hosted in the cloud**, the solution can be deployed on any of the following environments: **EKS** (AWS), **AKS** (Azure), **GKE** (Google)

3. **Self-hosted on-premises**, the main requirement for F5 to support the installation is that it is performed on **Red Hat OpenShift**
