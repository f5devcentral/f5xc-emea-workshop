General info

There are three options to deploy **F5 AI Guardrails** infrastructure.

1. **F5 SaaS** ( not F5XC ) where **F5 AI Guardrails** is already deployed.
   This is the fastest approch to get things running.

2. **Self hosted in the cloud**, the solution can be deployed on any of the following environments: **EKS** ( AWS ), **AKS** ( Azure ), **GKE** ( Google )

3. **Self hosted on prem**, the main requirnments for F5 to support the installation is to be performed on **Redhat Openshift**




**PLACEHOLDER** - Maybe add a little bit of info about the GPU requirnements.
