**F5 AI Guardrails** is an enterprise-grade AI runtime security and governance solution developed by F5, Inc. that helps organizations protect, control, and monitor how their AI systems behave in real-world usage. It acts as a layer of safeguards around generative AI and AI agents — ensuring security, compliance, and responsible operation beyond what is built into the AI models themselves.

The focus of this module will be to understand the deployment options and how to operate the F5 AI Guardrails console.
