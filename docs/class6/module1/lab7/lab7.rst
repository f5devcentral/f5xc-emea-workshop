Custom scanners
###############

This is where the magic starts.

There are three different types of scanner:

1. **Keyword scanner** - you can define specific keywords which will trigger the scanner. It can not only **block** but also **redact**.

2. **Regex scanner** - you can define specific regex filters which will trigger the scanner. It can not only **block** but also **redact**.

3. **GenAI scanner** - this is the real magic, define in natural language what you want to be identified and blocked. We will go in depth in the next section.
