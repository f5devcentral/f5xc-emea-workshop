Local API Discovery
###################

In this section, we will deploy the F5 Local API Discovery solution. 

Local API Discovery is a solution that helps you uncover and analyze API activity within your environment without relying on external connectivity or cloud-based services. It is ideal for deployments where data locality, privacy, or regulatory concerns demand self-managed API traffic inspection.
Local API Discovery collects and analyzes per-request HTTP metadata from BIG-IP systems. It detects both known and undocumented (shadow) API endpoints, tracks usage frequency, identifies sensitive data flows, and flags unauthenticated access points. All analysis and dashboards operate locally within your infrastructure whether on a physical server, virtual machine, or private cloud instance.

Designed for security-sensitive or air-gapped environments, LAD empowers teams to gain actionable API visibility, manage schema governance, and take mitigation actions all without exposing data outside your trusted network boundary.
