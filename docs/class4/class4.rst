**Welcome to the F5 Distributed Cloud - API Security lab**

Distributed Cloud API Security provides discovery and deep insights from use of AI/ML. Identify shadow APIs and block API attacks in real time and eliminate vulnerabilities at their source. The SaaS-based portal enables users to manage and go deep for threat analytics, forensics, and troubleshooting of API communications for modern applications.

APIs change frequently:

* Easily identify all API endpoints mapped to your applications and monitor anomalous activities or shadow APIs including blocking of suspicious requests and endpoints. 
* Generate API schema and Swagger files to minimize manual tracking of API endpoints.
* Reduce time spent configuring and deployi1ng API security policies.
