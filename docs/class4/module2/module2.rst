Dynamic API Protection
######################

In this section, we will protect the same modern application with F5 Distributed Cloud, but we will enable the **dynamic** protection where SecOps apply the API Discovery and Validation.

API Discovery relies on 3 different engines in order to protect API during the full API Development Lifecycle

* Code Base API discovery: we detect API endpoints from the code
* Crawler API Discovery (future release): we detect API endpoints from a crawler scanning all API endpoints
* Traffic API Discovery: we detect API endpoints from user traffic

**Module 2 - All sections**
