Enable API code scanning discovery (under construction)
=======================================================

F5 solutions can detect and protect APIs during the full API develoment lifecycle which includes also to learn API endpoints and further information to e.g. build the schema from the source code the developers create and maintain on the code repository.

We use the "Sentence application" source code for this lab which is available at the public Github repository: https://github.com/ca-scans/sentence-source-code-v2


.. note:: There is also a video and a FAQ avilable for F5 employees
